# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot

This is an arduino based robot which uses ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles . A motor driver IC and 2 DC motors are used for controlling the movement of the robot. A servo motor is also used. A Bluetooth module is added to control the robot from an android device.

# Objectives of the Project
Navigate safely by avoiding obstacles comes ahead.

Detecting the exact path by checking the sensor readings in different angles.

Send status of the robot movement (using Bluetooth module) to the nearby android phone when the robot is in automatic mode.

Navigate in manual mode by receiving signals from the phone.
